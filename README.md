[CLICK HERE TO VISIT THE CALCULATOR](https://codedmitry.github.io/Lambda-Calculator/)

The lambda calculator is basically a web browser developer console, with additional features. It is meant to primarily empower mobile users to do quick math or advanced lambda calculus without having to deal with annoying button calculators or getting up to their computer.

**A note on underscorejs**:

Any underscorejs vulnerabilities do not apply to this project, it is sandboxed and runs on the client side. The lambda calculator is about empowering the user to do arbitrary client side code execution, they can't hurt anyone except their own sandbox, which is easily restarted by reloading the page.
